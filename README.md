# **DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHMS NOTES**
This repository contains notes for helping to study data structures and algorithms, from
the basics to the advanced topics. This repository also contains the implementation for
all of this in Go (programming language).

**Why Go?**

Go is a compiled language, but unlike C has a modern software engineering approach embedded in 
the core language. Moreover, Go it's easy to read (like Python) and has a very good management
of low-level features, like pointers. Additionally, Go has a garbage collector (like Java), so 
you don't need to worry about free the memory.

## **Basics**
1. Memory data representation
    * Primitive Data types
    * Arrays
2. Composite data structures
    * Pointers
    * Stacks
    * Queues
    * Double-Queues
    * Circular lists
    * Linked lists
    * Double-linked lists
    * Abstract Data types
3. Strategies for algorithm construction
    * Greedy algorithms and brute force
    * Top-down and bottom-up
    * Divide and conquer
    * Recursion
    * Backtracking
4. Algorithm analysis
    * Complexity: P vs NP
    * _O_, _Omega_ and _Theta_ notations
    * Growth rates
